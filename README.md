# Baby_Cry_Detection_Using_ML
# 👶 Baby Cry Detection Using Machine Learning

A machine learning-based system that detects whether a baby is crying or not in the absence of parents, enabling real-time monitoring and alerting for infant care.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses audio classification techniques to detect baby cries in real-time. It is especially useful when parents or caregivers are not physically present, as it can notify them through an alert system when a baby is crying.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect baby crying sounds using ML algorithms.
- Differentiate between crying and other background noises.
- Enable real-time alerts to notify parents remotely.

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (optional)
- **Audio Processing**: Librosa, PyDub
- **Model**: Binary classifier (Cry vs. No Cry)
- **Deployment (Optional)**: Flask, Streamlit, or any web dashboard

## 🛠️ Features

- 📈 Accurate classification of baby cries vs other sounds
- 🔊 Real-time or recorded audio input
- ⚙️ Scalable model training and evaluation
- 🚨 Optional alert system (email, notification)
